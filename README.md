# Beyond Traditional Risk Management: AI Techniques for Enhanced Risk Modeling

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code developed for the thesis "Beyond Traditional Risk Management: Exploring AI-based Techniques for Better Risk Modeling and Decision Making" by Duvan Camilo David Higuita, submitted to the Graduate School of Economics and Management at Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

## Abstract
This thesis explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with project risk management and knowledge management to enhance the modeling and decision-making processes in managing project risks. By leveraging the knowledge of past projects, this work aims to provide innovative methods for organizations to navigate project risks more effectively and efficiently.

## Thesis Structure
- **Chapter 2:** Focuses on utilizing Bayesian networks (BN) for project change management based on expert knowledge and historical risk data, improving the accuracy of project plan adjustments.
- **Chapter 3:** Introduces a novel methodology for calculating overall project risk through partial least squares regression (PLSR), and evaluating the risk assessment practices of an organization.
- **Chapter 4:** Explores data augmentation via deep generative models (DGMs) to enhance project risk management, particularly in the context of small datasets.

## Contributions
- Empirical validation of AI-based approaches using data from two companies: Mineros and NSSol.
- Development of a framework for integrating Bayesian networks into change management processes.
- Introduction of a data-driven methodology for overall project risk calculation and risk assessment process evaluation.
- Exploration of data augmentation for generating project data and improving Bayesian network models in project risk management.
